# artificial-intelligence-project



This repository contains two projects where artificial intelligence (AI) search algorithms were researched and implemented: a Pacman game and a cleaning robot simulation.  

## Projects Overview  

### 1. Pacman Game  
In this project, I implemented various AI search algorithms to navigate a Pacman character through a maze while avoiding obstacles and reaching the goal.  

#### **Implemented Algorithms:**  
- **Bidirectional Search**  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
- **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)**  
- **Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS)**  
- **Simplified Memory-Bounded A* (SMA\*)**  

#### **Key Features:**  
- Real-time pathfinding with performance comparisons of different algorithms.  
- Visualization of the Pacman movement based on selected algorithms.
