# artificial-intelligence-project



This repository contains 3 projects where artificial intelligence (AI) search algorithms were researched and implemented.
## Projects Overview  

### 1. Pacman Game  
In this project, I developed alternative routes that the user can use starting from a certain city and going to the target city, using different alternative algorithms.

#### **Implemented Algorithms:**  
- **Bidirectional Search**  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
- **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)**  


#### **Key Features:**  
- Real-time pathfinding with performance comparisons of different algorithms.
